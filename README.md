# Course on Software Engineering v2

The repository contains slides for lectures on software engineering as held at the University of Ulm to teach undergraduate students in Computer Science. The course has been created from scratch between October 2020 and July 2021. Since then, the slides are continuously improved. If you have any feedback, please contact the main author [Thomas Th√ºm](mailto:thomas.thuem@uni-ulm.de).

This is the second public version of the slides. A newer version of the slides is not yet available, but you might want to checkout the [previous version](https://github.com/SoftVarE-Group/Software-Engineering-2020-2021) of the slides (e.g., to see missing topics).
